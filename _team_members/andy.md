Andrew became vicar in 2005, having previously served in churches in mid-Cheshire and the borders of Manchester.

Andrew is a keen musician, and absolutely the jack of many trades (piano, guitar, bass, drums, trumpet) and not at all the master of any.

Although getting on a bit, he still manages to get around the football pitch on a Sunday evening, albeit at a slightly slower pace than he once enjoyed!
