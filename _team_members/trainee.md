We'd love to welcome someone to serve and train with us for 2016-17. You would receive theological training through the [North West Partnership Ministry Training Course](http://northwestpartnership.com/training/ministry-training-course/its-purpose). The rest of the time would be spent in practical ministry and service, with an emphasis on teaching the Bible to children and young people - especially through local schools, but also among adults and the elderly.

If this looks like something youâ€™d love to be part of then [have a look at the advert](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pp89o4a75s29d7j/trainee.pdf?raw=1) and we'd be delighted to hear from you!
