St Mark's Church takes its duty and obligation to protect all extremely seriously.
 
The PCC has adopted the national Church of England's robust procedures and guidelines.

Our parish safeguarding officer is Mr Graham Kenworthy and can be contacted at church or by email: pso@stmarksnewferry.org.uk 
 
You can find out more about the national policies and procedures [here](https://www.churchofengland.org/safeguarding).
 
If you have any safeguarding concerns or issues of a safeguarding matter then you can find useful contact information [here](https://www.chester.anglican.org/social-responsibility/safeguarding).

"All parishes are required to participate in a Past Cases Review, commissioned by the Church of England. PCR2, as it is known nationally, is part of the Church's ongoing scrutiny of its handling of past and current safeguarding cases. An Independent Reviewer will be looking at files relating to church officers in this parish, both lay and ordained, past and present. 

"Individuals who wish to make representations to the PCR2 process, or who need to come forward with information or make any disclosures, are encouraged to make direct contact with the Diocesan Safeguarding Adviser. However, recognising that this may not feel safe for those with a lived experience of abuse from within the Church, a dedicated telephone helpline - 0800 80 20 20 - operated independently from the Church, by the NSPCC, has been set up."
