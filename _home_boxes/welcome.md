St Mark's is a Church of England Parish Church on the Wirral peninsula, and we have been making the Christian Faith known in New Ferry since our foundation in 1866.

**PUBLIC WORSHIP "ON HOLD"**

Due to the current coronavirus pandemic, we are not gathering together for public worship. We have made arrangements for a "virtual gathering" Sunday by Sunday, and a Facebook conversation group alongside our public Facebook page. If you would like to hear more please email vicar@stmarksnewferry.org.uk

Psalm 46 reminds us that "God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble." If you don't normally pray, then in these unprecedented days would be a good time to start! The LORD is still sovereign over all the world, and he cares for you.

The church members today are from all ages and all stages along the "journey of faith", and we hope these pages give you a picture of what we are like! A virtual visit is nothing like the real thing though - so please do feel very welcome to join us on a Sunday morning at 10:30am. You don't have to wear your "Sunday best" and you won't be asked to pray or read out loud. We are on New Chester Road right next to the New Ferry shops, with plenty of parking around the church building.

We have disabled access at the main door, and induction loop for the hard of hearing.

We look forward to seeing you.
