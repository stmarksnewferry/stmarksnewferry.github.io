St Mark's is a Church of England Parish Church on the Wirral peninsula, and we have been making the Christian Faith known in New Ferry since our foundation in 1866.

**We are open for our 10.30am Sunday morning meeting**

We re-opened the doors on 12th July, after 3 months or so meeting online using the "Zoom" platform. In order to maintain distance, and a safe environment, it would be really helpful to know if you intend to come along. We can only seat a certain number in the building, and rather than turn up and be told "sorry, we are full". We are still using the Zoom platform to enable people still shielding at home to be part of the meeting. Please email us: admin@stmarksnewferry.org.uk or follow our Facebook page to hear more â€¦ https://www.facebook.com/stmarksnewferry/

Finally, if you are feeling anxious, wondering where God is, and need someone to talk to, please do get in touch: vicar@stmarksnewferry.org.uk or 645 2638

The church members today are from all ages and all stages along the "journey of faith", and we hope these pages give you a picture of what we are like! A virtual visit is nothing like the real thing though - so please do feel very welcome to join us on a Sunday morning at 10:30am. You don't have to wear your "Sunday best" and you won't be asked to pray or read out loud. We are on New Chester Road right next to the New Ferry shops, with plenty of parking around the church building.

We have disabled access at the main door, and induction loop for the hard of hearing.

We look forward to seeing you.
