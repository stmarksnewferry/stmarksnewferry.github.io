title: Welcome to **St Mark's**!

St Mark's is a Church of England Parish Church on the Wirral peninsula, and we have been making the Christian Faith known in New Ferry since our foundation in 1866.

**Normal Service will be Resumed ... hopefully soon**

The church building is empty … and so is the grave where Jesus was buried! The disciples that first Easter morning were told “He is not here, he is risen!”

As we enter the season of Easter we rejoice in the new life and living hope given to us through the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.

At a time where hopes are dashed the focus on the news is how many more deaths due to the pandemic have occurred since yesterday. At the same time the message about Jesus, and the life and hope he offers, is all the more attractive.

The church members today are from all ages and all stages along the "journey of faith", and we hope these pages give you a picture of what we are like! A virtual visit is nothing like the real thing though - so please do feel very welcome to join us on a Sunday morning at 10:30am. You don't have to wear your "Sunday best" and you won't be asked to pray or read out loud. We are on New Chester Road right next to the New Ferry shops, with plenty of parking around the church building.

We have disabled access at the main door, and induction loop for the hard of hearing.

We look forward to seeing you.
