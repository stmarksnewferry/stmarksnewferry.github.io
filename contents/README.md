# Editing the content of the site

Content can be found in the directories:

* `_home_boxes` - boxes for the "Home" page
* `_about_boxes` - boxes for the "About" page
* `_team` - sections for the team box on the "About" page
* `_whats_on` - boxes for the "What's On" page

Each file corresponds to a box on one of the pages of the site, and the boxes are sorted by the file name.

Some content can be found in the respective `.html` files: `index.html` for the home page, then `about.html`, `contact.html` and `whats-on.html` for the other pages.

Files ending in `.md` use [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics), which makes it easy to format text (bold, italic, lists, etc) and to include links (e.g., `[link text](http://www.example.com)` becomes [link text](http://www.example.com)).

You can upload images to the `img` folder, and then compare other files to see how to include them in the content. It's best to copy the sizes of existing files: 1110x530 for the carousel images on the front page, 750x450 for the pictures of staff members, 1920x1080 for the background, and a width of 360 for other pictures included in boxes.
