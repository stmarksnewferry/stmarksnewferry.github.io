# St Mark's New Ferry Website

## Editing the content of the site

Once you have access to this repository, you can just edit the files on [GitHub](https://github.com/stmarksnewferry/stmarksnewferry.github.io). When you save the file (or 'commit it to the repository'), the [real site](http://stmarksnewferry.github.io/) will update by magic.

To edit the _content_ of the site, go to the [contents folder](https://github.com/stmarksnewferry/stmarksnewferry.github.io/tree/master/contents) and follow the instructions...

## Changing the appearance

This is done via the files in `_layouts` and `_includes`. If you want to make significant changes, it's best to experiment on something other than the real site! See below...

## More details

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). For major site edits, it's best to install Jekyll on your computer and [set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git), and then you can edit the files on your computer and test it out before making changes to the real site.

For the site's appearance, it uses the [Business Casual](http://startbootstrap.com/business-casual) theme, which is built using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
