As a church we are convinced that the message of the Bible (written so long ago) is both relevant and life giving in our own day.

If you have an eye to church history, we stand in the Reformed tradition of the Church of England; taking the Bible as the supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct, and upholding the historic formularies of the Church of England (the [Book of Common Prayer](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer), the [Thirty Nine Articles](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer/articles-religion) and the [Ordinal](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer/form-and-manner-making-ordaining)) as our inheritance of faith to be proclaimed afresh in the present generation.

In support of the GAFCON movement, we have adopted the [Jerusalem Declaration](https://www.gafcon.org/resources/the-complete-jerusalem-statement) as an accurate statement of our core beliefs, and in 2016 we sent letters of request (under the House of Bishopsâ€™ Declaration on the Ministry of Bishops and Priests) to the Diocesan Bishop and can access the oversight of the [Bishop of Maidstone](https://bishopofmaidstone.org) who is an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Chester.
