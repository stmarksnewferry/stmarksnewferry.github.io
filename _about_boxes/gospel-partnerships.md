We are a founding member of the [North West Partnership of Churches](http://www.northwestpartnership.com/). This reflects our commitment to the evangelical faith (which is the historic foundation of our Church of England) and the desire to see Biblical Christianity thrive in our region.

We also belong to the [Wirral Gospel Partnership](http://www.wirralgospelpartnership.org.uk/), working together to strengthen local ministry.
