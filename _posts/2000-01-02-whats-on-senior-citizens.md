**Tuesday Fellowship**

an afternoon meeting with senior citizens in mind, meeting most Tuesday afternoons in the church hall from 2pm. The Fellowship has a range of guest speakers, and a time to sing hymns, pray and hear the Christian message. The image is from a visit by Neil Baldwin ('Nello') in 2015, and you can read a full report [on the Diocese of Chester website](http://www.chester.anglican.org/news.asp?Page=821).

**Lunch Club**

A great team of cooks prepare a good hot dinner for senior citizens, who enjoy not only the food but a time of fellowship together. The Lunch Club takes place on a Friday lunchtime (12 noon).

Afterwards there is a cuppa and a chat for those who would like to stay on. It is called "Lunch Club Plus", and includes a "thought for the day".
