There are two things that are central to what we are:

First is the great command of Jesus - to love God with all that we are, and to love our neighbours as ourselves. When we gather as a church family we seek to express our love for God in praise, prayer, and obedient listening to his Word, the Bible; and to support one another as we live the Christian life day by day.

Second is the great mission Jesus gave the church - to go and make disciples of all nations. Every square inch of our nation is served by a Church of England parish church, and the duty and joy of that church family is to make known the good news of Jesus Christ to every new generation.
