**Sundays**

Our main Sunday service is at 10.30am and lasts for around one hour. The central focus of our meeting is the Bible, often referred to as the Word of God, read and explained and responded to in prayer and praise.

The first Sunday of the month is (usually) an "All Age Service". There is a creche for pre-school children. The creche room has an audio-visual feed from the service so there is no need to miss out while watching over the children.

On other Sundays there is creche, separate groups for Key Stage 1 and 2 children, and for those young people in secondary education.

The third and fifth Sundays of the month include Holy Communion.

**Homegroups**

It is good to belong to a large group who meet week by week as God's family. But it is also good to meet with a smaller number of folks in a more informal setting. We have nine small groups that meet to study the Bible and encourage one another along the journey of faith. They meet around the parish and wider area, some in the daytime, some in the evening.

Currently the groups look at the part of the Bible that was the focus of the Sunday talk, and members encourage each other to respond to what we discover by the way we live day by day.

**Children**

Our children and youth leadership team are all registered with the DBS (Disclosurer and Barring Service), and we operate a child protection policy that ensures that children are always safe.

As well as creche and groups for children and young people on Sundays, we also have midweek groups.

Younger children arrive at 5.45pm and have their group for an hour.

Older children (school year 6 upwards) arrive at 6.45pm until 8pm.

**Tuesday Fellowship**

an afternoon meeting with senior citizens in mind, meeting most Tuesday afternoons in the church hall from 2pm. The Fellowship has a range of guest speakers, and a time to sing hymns, pray and hear the Christian message.

**Lunch Club**

A great team of cooks prepare a good hot dinner for senior citizens, who enjoy not only the food but a time of fellowship together. The Lunch Club takes place on a Friday lunchtime (12 noon).

Afterwards there is a cuppa and a chat for those who would like to stay on. It is called "Lunch Club Plus", and includes a "thought for the day".

**Football**

A few years ago we started a bit of a kick about. This turned into a weekly fixture! We play on a Sunday evening, for fun, in the Village Hall. 7.30pm for an hour.
