It is good to belong to a large group who meet week by week as God's family. But it is also good to meet with a smaller number of folks in a more informal setting. We have nine small groups that meet to study the Bible and encourage one another along the journey of faith. They meet around the parish and wider area, some in the daytime, some in the evening.

Currently the groups look at the part of the Bible that was the focus of the Sunday talk, and members encourage each other to respond to what we discover by the way we live day by day.
