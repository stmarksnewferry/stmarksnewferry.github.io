title: Christianity **Explored**
---
It isn't necessary to have it all worked out before you can come to St Marks! Often folks are "just looking" at the Christian faith. "Christianity Explored" is an informal way to find answers to those questions.

**Who is it for?** Anyone who wants to find out what Christianity is really about, and whether its claims are true. We assume no previous knowledge about God, the Bible, Church ... or anything! As well as those "just looking", it is also good for new-ish Christians, and those who want to go over the basics again.

**What happens?** An evening consists of discussion, looking at one of the Bible's accounts of the life of Jesus, and explaining what the Bible says about a given issue. Some people prefer to just sit and listen to what others say. Others like to come with all sorts of questions of their own. You will not be asked to read aloud, pray, or sing. You can ask any questions you want.

**When?** Usually twice a year.
