Our children and youth leadership team are all registered with the DBS (Disclosurer and Barring Service), and we operate a child protection policy that ensures that children are always safe.

As well as creche and groups for children and young people on Sundays, we also have midweek groups.

Younger children arrive at 5.45pm and have their group for an hour.

Older children (school year 6 upwards) arrive at 6.45pm until 8pm.
