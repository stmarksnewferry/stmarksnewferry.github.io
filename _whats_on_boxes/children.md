**Primary Children**

As well groups for children on Sunday mornings, we have also had a monthly Sunday afternoon group in the church hall during which parents can have a cuppa and chat in the church lounge.

Our children and youth leadership team are all registered with the DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service), and we operate the Diocesan Safeguarding Policy that ensures that children are always safe.
