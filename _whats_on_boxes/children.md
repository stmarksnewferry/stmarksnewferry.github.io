**Crossway**

A group for key stage 2 children, and tea, coffee & chat for their carers. We meet on Wednesday at 4pm - 5.15pm in term time in St Mark's Church Hall.

Our children and youth leadership team are all registered with the DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service), and we operate the Diocesan Safeguarding Policy that ensures that children are always safe.
