Our children and youth leadership team are all registered with the DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service), and we operate a child protection policy that ensures that children are always safe.

As well as creche and groups for children and young people on Sundays, we also have midweek groups.

Younger children (key stage 1 and 2) meet Tuesdays in term time in the church hall, from 5.45 to 6.45pm.

Older children (key stage 3) meet Tuesdays in term time in the church lounge, from 5.45 to 7pm.
