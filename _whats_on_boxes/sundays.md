**Mornings**

Our main Sunday service is at 10.30am and lasts for around one hour. The central focus of our meeting is the Bible, often referred to as the Word of God, read and explained and responded to in prayer and praise.

The first Sunday of the month is (usually) an "All Age Service". There is a creche for pre-school children. The creche room has an audio-visual feed from the service so there is no need to miss out while watching over the children.

On other Sundays there is creche, separate groups for Key Stage 1 and 2 children, and for those young people in secondary education.

The third and fifth Sundays of the month include Holy Communion.

**Evenings:**

On the second Sunday of the month we have our central prayer meeting. We begin with a shared "tea" at 5:15pm and then pray from 5.45pm-6.45pm.

On the last Sunday of the month we have our "Final Sunday Focus" from 5.30pm to 7pm. This is a siminar-syle meeting looking at aspects of Christian doctrine and church history.
