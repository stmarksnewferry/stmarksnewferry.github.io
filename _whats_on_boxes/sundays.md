**Mornings**

Our main Sunday service is at 10.30am and lasts for around one hour. The central focus is meeting Jesus in the Bible as it is read, explained and responded to in prayer and praise.

The first Sunday of the month is (usually) an "All Age Service". There is a creche for pre-school children. The creche room has an audio-visual (Zoom) feed from the service so there is no need to miss out while watching over the children.

On other Sundays there is creche, and separate groups for Key Stage 1 and 2 children.

The third and fifth Sundays of the month include Holy Communion.

**Evenings:**

occasional seminar series or other gatherings make use of the Sunday evening slot.
