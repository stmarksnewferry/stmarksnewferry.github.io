**Tuesday Fellowship**

an afternoon meeting with senior citizens in mind, meeting most Tuesday afternoons in the church hall from 2pm. The Fellowship has a range of guest speakers, and a time to sing hymns, pray and hear the Christian message. The image is from a visit by Neil Baldwin ('Nello') in 2015.
